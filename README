= This is Kallisto.

What does it do? Right now, it listens to syslog(1) under OS X and allows you to view
the log information in a web UI. 

And that's about it. Kallisto has a long way to go before it's really usable. But you
are welcome to play with it, should you be so inclined.

Thank you and have a nice day!
