LogMentor
=========

LogMentor is the guts of Kallisto. It does all the handling of reading 
logs, parsing them into HTML. Since this was originally written under 
OS X, it includes a listener for Darwin's unfriendly syslog(1). 

LogMentor is still pretty crude as of 5/19/2011. There's a lot I want to 
do with it, such as:

1. Make sure it runs under UNIX that is not Darwin.
2. Find logs that are being updated at intervals of /t/ and provide them 
   as an attr_reader for display in the UI.
3. And a bunch of other things that are crowding each other out of my brain 
   right now.

Example
=======

lm = LogMentor.new 
lm.poll


ToDo
=======

1. Get HTMLized lines to UI.
