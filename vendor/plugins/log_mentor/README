LogMentor
=========

LogMentor is the guts of Kallisto. It does all the handling of reading 
logs, parsing them into HTML. Since this was originally written under 
OS X, it includes a listener for Darwin's unfriendly syslog(1). 

LogMentor is still pretty crude as of 5/19/2011. 


Example
=======

>> lm = LogMentor.new `uname`.strip!
>> lm.poll "ftp.log"

ToDo
=======

1. Currently requires a yaml configuration file in $RAILS_ROOT/config. It
   might be nicer to have the plugin be more independent in that it could
   figure out where the log files are by the operating system.
2. Following from that find logs that are being updated at intervals of /t/ 
   and provide them as an attr_reader for display in the UI.
3. User-specified log files.
4. All log data goes into redis store?
5. Make sure it runs under UNIX that is not Darwin.
6. And a bunch of other things that are crowding each other out of my brain 
   right now.
